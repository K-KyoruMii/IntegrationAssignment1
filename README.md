This is a set of VERY simple Java games, which includes a rudimentary version of Rock Paper Scissors against a computer opponent and a number guessing game.

The code should work in most online compilers.

Instructions for use:
1. Download the Java file for the game you want to play.

2. Upload the Java file to an online compiler like at https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_java_compiler and run the code.

3. The game will instruct you on what to do next.
