This is a set of VERY simple Java games, which includes a rudimentary version of Rock Paper Scissors against a computer opponent and a number guessing game.

The code should work in most online compilers.

Instructions for use:
1. Copy and paste the entire code of ONE file to https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/ and run the code.

2. Change "class RPS" or "class Guess" to "class Main".

3. The game will instruct you on what to do next.
